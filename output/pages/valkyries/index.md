Valkyries are volunteers who have been designated to handle any incidents that arise in our community.  They have undergone training in conflict resolution and can offer safe spaces at events for attendees to seek assistance or shelter.  If you feel uncomfortable for any reason at an event, please reach out to a Valkyrie or Host.

You can also report any issues that arose during an event using our [Incident Form](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NVsIo5Qz7G6B_tqN1PfPk8-aUZr-CF8ADmFCFwruZHc).  Valkyries will review reported incidents and determine the best course of action to take.
