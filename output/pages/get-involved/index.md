Below are some specific volunteer opportunities we have available. If you are interested in getting involved in any way, please [sign up](http://eepurl.com/gj378v)!

### Event Hosts

Our Event Hosts volunteer a significant amount of time to run recurring events every month - or even every week! - and sometimes they need a break.  We are always on the lookout for folks we can call upon to cover various events when the usual hosts are sick, have a schedule conflict, or just plain need a day off!

### Event Helpers

Often, especially at our larger events, there is more work to do at the event than the Hosts can manage on their own.  This might include setup, decoration, ushering, etc - whatever the event calls for folks on the ground to be doing.

### Volunteer Coordinator

Manages volunteer outreach and keeping track of available volunteers and their skills to put to use as the organization needs.

### Culture Moderator

Moderates consent and safety, Advocates for healthy poly culture in the community, Manages privacy, 1:1 community member education as needed.

### Valkyries

The Valkyries are a team of volunteers who are tasked with helping our community remain a safe and respectful place.  We would like to form a large enough team of Valkyries that each event can have at least one Valkyrie attending, so that Hosts can focus on simply running the event, and a Valkyrie will be available to handle any tense situations that arise.  This may sound like an intimidating job to many, but OPEN Northwest will strive to support our Valkyries with the resources and training they need to help keep our community safe.

### Event Media Coordinator

Since we connect with folks across multiple platforms such as Meetup and Facebook, we are looking for a volunteer to help ensure that events are posted on all relevant platforms.  You would work with event hosts and the social media coordinator to help keep everything in sync.

### Social Media Coordinator

Curates and maintains the organization's social media presence on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, FetLife, and others.

### Outreach Coordinator

We are certainly not the only community of ethically non-monogamous folks around.  We'd love to bring someone on who can focus on reaching out to other communities to keep lines of communication open, cross-promote events, collaborate on projects, etc.

### Organizational Brain Power

Many of us who have been volunteering for OPEN Northwest since we became a non-profit are admittedly fairly new to this business of running an organization!  We are passionate about what we're doing and have been working hard to see OPEN Northwest succeed, but we would welcome more folks getting involved on an organizational level to help us steer this ship towards continued success.

### Grant Writer

At our current stage as an organization, we are more or less already offering all the resources and services to our community that our community can pay for.

However, we want to give our community even more!  To that end, we are looking for a grant writer to help us seek out and apply for funding opportunities that suit an organization like ours.

### Artists/Photographers

We sure are tired of the stock photos of several feet poking out of a white comforter, as well as one person holding hands with another behind the back of a seemingly oblivious third.  We need more, better poly representation.  And, more practically, OPEN Northwest will occasionally need art or graphics for our website, promotional materials, etc.  We certainly recognize that artists are too often called on to give away their work, but right now as an organization we are running on volunteer power, so we deeply appreciate anything folks can spare.

### Ambassador Buddy System

Are you naturally outgoing and love meeting new people? Volunteer to be an Ambassador Buddy! As an extroverted guide, you'll help introverted attendees feel welcome and included at events. Your role is to break the ice, encourage conversation, and ensure no one feels left out. It's a fun and rewarding way to connect with others and create a supportive, inclusive community. Join us in making events a warm, welcoming space for everyone!

### Speed Dating Coordinator

We aren't sure when we will be able to resume this event, but when we do, we'll need a coordinator. This is a big role that involves learning the tool we use for the speed dating matching, engendering a relationship with the developer of the application, and coordinating the schedule and execution of the event which involves managing the volunteers and delegating tasks.

### Whatever You Bring To The Table!

We know our community is full of amazing people who have innumerable skills and passions to offer.  We'd love to hear your ideas, and anything that you are interested in doing for our community.
