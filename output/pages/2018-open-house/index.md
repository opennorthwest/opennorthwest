Regrettably, OPEN Northwest’s OPEN House event, originally scheduled for the weekend of May 18th through 20th, has been cancelled due to financial and logistical complications. Those who have purchased tickets have been contacted individually regarding a refund.

However!! We are still planning a fun-filled weekend in place of the OPEN House, starting with Poly Speed Dating the evening of Friday May 18th. Please see the Speed Dating event page to register. This event is only $20 and uses a sophisticated system that considers criteria you provide about who you are and what you are seeking to pair you with prospective dates. It’s also a great social event to mix and mingle and get to know the members in our community! Register at: http://opennorthwest.org/speed-dating/

Following the Speed Dating event, we will be hosting a Poly Potluck BBQ and Fundraiser on Saturday May 19th. This event will be offered at no cost to our community. Further details will be posted on our Meetup and Facebook pages in the next week or so.

For those of you who were excited for Prom, no need to fret! We are evaluating the possibility of hosting a formal Gala event later in the year for you to don your fancy wear and have a wonderful night of music and dance. Stay tuned and keep an eye out for more information to come!
